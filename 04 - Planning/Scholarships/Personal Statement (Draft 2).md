The utmost motivation for seeking this opportunity has been, and continue to be, quenching my endless curiosity and passion for understanding the intricacies of the natural world. Although theories are as important as they come, I truly believe one must create and invent things which would demand the application said-theories to understand the core of the subject matter. 

I have been a bit of a schoolhopper. Starting at CIA First International, in the second grade, and continued studying until the ninth. However, due to financial hardships my family faced, I bounced over to Santhormok Highschool for the remainder of my schooling. 

Throughout middle school, Performance Tasks were the sole foundation of any semester. These tasks included building a functioning thermos bottle, food warmer, 3D modelling in SketchUp, and more. These tasks required the application of what we’ve learnt, some predicated entirely on teamwork whilst others were individual. Throughout the hard work, I was awarded a one-year scholarship for my performance in 6th grade.

My teachers have always noticed my inquisitive nature and was always willing to nurture, often by providing insight I had. It became a playground for my curious mind. I loved learning about science, history, philosophy, psychology – anything that sparked my imagination. But I am deeply immersed in the sciences, due to its innate nature to elegantly model the world around us in precision.

I strongly believe that education is not merely about acquiring facts and figures, but also the cultivation of a mind capable of critical thought; to recognize patterns where others see chaos. Intrinsically, the odyssey in pursuit of truth. 

Outside of school, I've partaken in several activities since moving to Santhormok. One of which was a Graduation Ceremony for ACE, where I volunteered to assist in escorting students, parents, and guardians to their designated spots; all of which were coordinated ahead of time by the organization, which also included teams and their zones. It was an amazing experience for making new friends and a thrill to work interdependently. 

Continuing from that, the second event I’ve partaken in was the 9th Global Alumni Convention Education and Careers Expo hosted by IDP, where I had the honor to volunteer as the interpreter for Monash University. Again, I had experience the enthusiasm of working with other volunteer members and the privilege to assist parents, guardians, and students that came by the booth. 

Since taking the national exam, I have taken a year off in-pursuit of developing new skills, specifically in Computer Science. In grace of good fortune, applied for and eventually got accepted into Above and Beyond vocational training school founded by Edtech company EMCAST from South Korea and the Korean government KOICA. 

At AnB, I have been able to develop an in-depth understanding of algorithms and Data structures through hands-on practice programming sessions and pair programming. Following this, we’ve cloned a static website as part of our web development course, and furthur understanding UI/UX design and coding conventions. We’ve also had the great pleasure to participate as teams in a hackathon hosted by AnB as part of our Data Analysis course using Python. Ultimately, our team, LUCK, won first place.
