## Revised Draft (Suggested)

**Introduction**

From a young age, I've been captivated by the natural world. The intricate workings of our universe have always filled me with wonder and a desire to understand. This curiosity has driven me to explore various fields of science, from biology to physics, and ultimately led me to pursue engineering.

**Academic Background**

My academic journey began at CIA First International, where I developed a strong foundation in the sciences. Performance Tasks, a key component of our curriculum, required practical application of theoretical knowledge. These hands-on projects, such as building a functioning thermos bottle, not only solidified my interest in engineering but also honed my problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

After transferring to Santhormok High School due to financial constraints, I faced new challenges. While my passion for learning remained unwavering, the lack of additional resources and extracurricular opportunities presented some obstacles. However, I adapted to these circumstances, utilizing my limited resources to continue my academic pursuits.

**Extracurricular Activities**

Beyond the classroom, I've actively participated in various extracurricular activities. Volunteering at the ACE Graduation Ceremony and the IDP Global Alumni Convention Expo allowed me to develop valuable interpersonal skills and work collaboratively with others. These experiences also instilled in me a sense of civic responsibility and a desire to give back to my community.

**Computer Science Journey**

Taking a year off after the national exam, I pursued a vocational training program in computer science at AnB. This program provided me with a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and web development. Through hands-on practice and collaborative projects, I honed my technical skills and gained valuable experience in problem-solving and teamwork.

**Vocational Training**

To supplement my academic education, I took a year off after the national exam to pursue a vocational training program in computer science at AnB. This program provided me with a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and web development. Through hands-on practice and collaborative projects, I honed my technical skills and gained valuable experience in problem-solving and teamwork.

**Engineering Interests**

While I have a particular interest in computer science, I am drawn to engineering as a whole. The ability to design, create, and innovate to solve real-world problems is incredibly inspiring. I am interested in exploring various fields of engineering, such as mechanical, electrical, or civil engineering, to determine where my skills and passions align best.

**Conclusion**

My academic journey, coupled with my extracurricular experiences and vocational training, has equipped me with the knowledge, skills, and passion necessary to succeed in the field of engineering. Despite facing challenges due to financial limitations, I have demonstrated my resilience and determination to overcome obstacles. I am eager to continue my education and contribute to the advancement of engineering and technology.
