Alright, let's dive into this. So, I've always been a bit of a theorist. Ever since I was a kid, I've been obsessed with analyzing everything from video games to pop culture. I've spent countless hours exploring hidden meanings, deciphering codes, and connecting the dots.

I've learned a lot along the way. About critical thinking, problem-solving, and the power of storytelling. I've realized that there's always more to a story than meets the eye.
