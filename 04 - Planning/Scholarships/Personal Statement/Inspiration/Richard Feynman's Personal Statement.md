I've been a bit of a schoolhopper. Started at CIA First International in the second grade, and stuck with it until ninth. It was a decent place, I suppose. They taught me how to work with others, which is a good thing, I guess. But I wanted to try something new, so I bounced over to Santhormok High for the rest of my schooling.

Now, I'm not one for fancy words or big theories. I'm more interested in figuring out how things work. My time in school has been like a big puzzle, with each class piece fitting into the next. I've learned a lot about science and math, but more importantly, I've learned how to ask questions and find answers. And that's what really excites me about the future.
