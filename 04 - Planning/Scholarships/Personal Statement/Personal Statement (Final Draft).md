From a young age, I've been deeply fascinated by the natural world. School became a playground for my curious mind. I loved learning about science, history, philosophy, psychology, and anything else that would sparked my imagination. However, I became deeply immersed in the sciences, which inspired me to pursue engineering.

The utmost motivation for seeking this opportunity has been, and continue to be, quenching my endless curiosity and passion for understanding the intricacies of the natural world. Although theories are as important as they come, I truly believe one must create and invent things which would demand the application said-theories to understand the core of the subject matter. 

Initially starting from Santhormok Primary School, my parents moved me to CIA First International; which is where I developed a strong foundation the sciences. Performance tasks were a key component of our curriculum, requiring practical application of theoretical knowledge. These hands-on projects, such as building a functional thermos bottle, 3D modelling in SketchUp, writing hypothetical plans for energy conservation, and many others, not only solidified my interest in engineering, but also sharpened my problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

In 6th grade, I was awarded a one-year scholarship in recognition of my passion for learning and performance. This not only boosted my confidence but also motivated me to continue striving for excellence.

After transferring to Santhormok High School due to financial constraints, I faced new challenges. While my passion for learning remained unwavering, the lack of additional resources and extracurricular opportunities presented some obstacles. However, I adapted to these circumstances, utilizing my limited resources to continue my academic pursuits.

Despite the financial challenges, however, I have continued to actively engage in extracurricular activities whenever possible. In 12th grade, I competed in a national math competition, demonstrating my passion for mathematics and my ability to solve challenging problems. Although, I did not advance to the national level, the experience has helped me develop my problem-solving skills.

Since moving to Santhormok, I've partaken in several extracurricular activities outside of the classroom. Volunteering at the ACE Graduation Ceremony and the IDP Global Alumni Convention Expo allowed me to develop valuable interpersonal skills, as well as, working collaboratively with others. The entire experiences instilled in me a sense of civic responsibility and a desire to help others.

In the 9th Global Alumni Convention Education and Careers Expo hosted by IDP, I had the honor to volunteer as the interpreter for Monash University. Again, I had experience the enthusiasm of working with other volunteer members and the privilege to assist parents, guardians, and students that came by the booth. 

To further expand my academic education, I have taken a year off after the national exam to develop new skills under a vocational training program in computer science at AnB. The program provided me with a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and web development, by hands-on practice and collaborative projects. This drastically improved my technical skills, gaining insight and valuable experiences in problem-solving, UI/UX Design, web application development, and teamwork.

One of my most significant accomplishments during this program was participating as a member of the LUCK team in a hackathon hosted by AnB. While I didn't take on a leadership role, I actively contributed to the team's success by means of data cleaning and analyzing for patterns over confusing problems. Our team's collaborative efforts ultimately resulted in us securing first place, which was a rewarding experience.

I strongly believe that education is not merely about acquiring facts and figures, but also the cultivation of a mind capable of critical thought; to recognize patterns where others see chaos. Intrinsically, the odyssey in pursuit of truth. 

My academic journey, coupled alongside my extracurricular experiences and vocational training, has equipped me with the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue success in the field of engineering. Despite facing challenges due to financial hardships, I have demonstrated my resilience and determination to overcome obstacles. I am deeply passionate about continuing my education to contribute and inspire others in the advancement of engineering and technology â€“ which is undoubtedly a crucial facet of a developing nation.
