### Are grades the only limiting factor for scholarships
---

**Grades are generally considered important for scholarships, but they are not the only factor.** While high grades can certainly increase your chances of receiving a scholarship, many scholarship committees also consider other factors such as:

- **Extracurricular activities:** Participation in clubs, sports, or community service can demonstrate your well-roundedness and commitment.
  
- **Essays and letters of recommendation:** These can provide insights into your personal qualities, goals, and potential.
  
- **Demonstrated leadership:** Leadership experience, whether in school, community organizations, or extracurricular activities, can be a valuable asset.
  
- **Financial need:** Some scholarships prioritize students with financial need.

**While it's true that many scholarships are awarded to students with high grades, there are also scholarships available for students with average or slightly above-average grades.** These scholarships often focus on other factors, such as diversity, community involvement, or specific fields of study.

**It's important to research scholarships that align with your interests, goals, and qualifications.** Many scholarship databases allow you to filter your search based on factors such as GPA, major, and financial need.

**Additionally, consider reaching out to your guidance counselor or college admissions office for advice on finding scholarships.** They can provide you with personalized guidance and help you identify opportunities that match your profile.
