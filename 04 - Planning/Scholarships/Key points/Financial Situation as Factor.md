### Should I mention my financial situation?
---
**Yes, it can be a good idea to mention your financial situation in your scholarship applications.** Many scholarships are specifically designed to help students from low-income backgrounds. By highlighting your financial need, you can demonstrate to the scholarship committee that you are a deserving candidate who would benefit greatly from their support.

Here are some tips for mentioning your financial situation in your scholarship applications:

- **Be specific:** Instead of simply saying that you come from a low-income family, provide specific details about your financial challenges. For example, you could mention that you are the first person in your family to attend college, or that your parents struggle to cover basic expenses.
  
- **Focus on your resilience:** Emphasize how your financial difficulties have motivated you to work hard and achieve your goals. Show that you have the determination and perseverance to overcome obstacles and succeed.
  
- **Connect your financial need to your academic goals:** Explain how receiving a scholarship would help you achieve your educational aspirations. For example, you could discuss how it would allow you to focus on your studies without having to worry about part-time jobs or student loans.

**Remember, it's important to be honest and genuine in your application.** By sharing your financial situation, you can increase your chances of receiving a scholarship that will help you achieve your dreams.
