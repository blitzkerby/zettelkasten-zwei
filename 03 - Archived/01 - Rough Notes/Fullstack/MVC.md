(read this for a more detailed explanation [MVC Framework](https://www.guru99.com/mvc-tutorial.html))

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements:

- Model : the internal representations of information
- View : the interface that presents information to and accepts it from the user
- Controller : the software linking the two

### Model 
---
The central component of the pattern. It is the applicationâ€™s dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface.

ðŸ‘‰ About the appâ€™s more technical aspects

ðŸ‘‰ Bridge between model and view layers

## Business Logic
