[React’s Source Code](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react/src)


JavaScript has “`async`” and “`await`” methods, used for promises.

Assume the following example,

```JS
async function fetchData(link)
{
	try
	{
		let reponse = await fetch(link)
		let data    = await response.json();	
	
		console.log(data)
	}

	catch (error)
	{
		console.error("Error fetching data:", error)
	}
	
}


fetchData('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
```


### Explanation:

1. **Async Function**: The `async` keyword before the function declaration makes it an asynchronous function, which means it will return a promise.
   
2. **Await Keyword**: The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the async function until the promise is resolved. In this example, `await fetch(...)` waits for the fetch request to complete, and `await response.json()` waits for the response to be parsed as JSON.
   
3. **Error Handling**: The `try...catch` block is used to handle any errors that might occur during the asynchronous operations.



This example fetches data from a placeholder API and logs it to the console. If there’s an error during the fetch, it will be caught and logged.

Feel free to try this out in your code! If you have any specific scenarios or further questions, let me know.

Assume some object:

```JS
const someObject = {
    title: "The Lord of the Rings",
    publicationDate: "1954-07-29",
    author: "J. R. R. Tolkien",
    genres: [
      "fantasy",
      "high-fantasy",
      "adventure",
      "fiction",
      "novels",
      "literature",
    ],
    hasMovieAdaptation: true,
    pages: 1216,
    translations: {
      spanish: "El señor de los anillos",
      chinese: "魔戒",
      french: "Le Seigneur des anneaux",
    },
    reviews: {
      goodreads: {
        rating: 4.52,
        ratingsCount: 630994,
        reviewsCount: 13417,
      },
      librarything: {
        rating: 4.53,
        ratingsCount: 47166,
        reviewsCount: 452,
      },
    },
  },
```


it is then possible to de-structure it as such:

```JS
const {title, author} = someObject
```

This allows for quick access to the data stored directly in the object.

### Rest Operator

The rest operator allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It’s often used in function parameters. 



Assume the following function,
$$
Sum(1,2,3,4) = 10
$$

In JavaScript, this function can be written as follows:
```JS
function Sum(...numbers){
	return nubmers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0)
}
```




### Spread Operator

The spread operator allows you to expand an iterable (like an array) into individual elements. It’s useful for copying arrays, combining arrays, or passing array elements as arguments to a function.



Assume the following procedure,
$$
C = A \cup B
$$

In JavaScript, it is written as,

```JS
const A = [1,2,3]
const B = [4,5,6]

const C = [...A, ...B] // [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

## What is JSX?

- Declarative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work 

* Components must return a block of JSX 
  
* Extension of JavaScript that allows us to embed JavaScript, CSS, and React components into html
  
* Each JSX element is converted to a `React.createElement` function call

## Props

>
	Props are used to pass data from *parent components* to *child components* 
> 	
> 	(down the components tree)
> 	


> 
	Essential tool to configure and customize components 
> 
> 	(like function parameters)
> 	



> 
	With props, parent components control how child components look and work
> 


> 
	**Anything** can be passed as props: single values, arrays, objects, functions, even other components
> 


```jsx
function CourseRating()
{
	const [rating, setRating] = useState(0);

	return (
		<Rating 
			text="Course Rating"
			currentRating={Rating}
			numOptions={3}
			options={["Terrible", "Okay", "Amazing"]}
			allRatings={{num:2390, avg:4.8}}
			setRating={setRating}
			component={Star}
		/>			
	)
}

```

Props is data coming from the ***outside***, and can only be updated by the ***parent component***.

![Props are read-only, they are immutable! This is one of React’s strict rules]
![If you need to mutate props, you actually need state]


![[Pasted image 20240724233157.png]]

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

const messages = [
  "Learn React ⚛",
  "Apply for jobs 🤩",
  "Invest your new income 🤑",
]


export default function App()
{
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1)

  function handlePrevious()
  {
    if(step > 1)
      setStep(step - 1);
  }

  function handleNext()
  {
    if(step < 3)
      setStep(step + 1);
  }


  return <>
    <div className="steps">
      
      <div className="numbers">
        <div className={`${   step >= 1 ? "active" : ""   }`}>1</div>
        <div className={`${   step >= 2 ? "active" : ""   }`}>2</div>
        <div className={`${   step >= 3 ? "active" : ""   }`}>3</div>
      </div>
      
      <p className="message">
        Step {step} : {messages[step-1]}
      </p>

      <div className="buttons">


        <button 
            style={{backgroundColor:"#7950f2", color:"#fff"}}
            onClick={() => handlePrevious()}
          >Previous</button>


        <button 
              style={{backgroundColor:"#7950f2", color:"#fff"}}
              onClick={() => handleNext()}
            >Next</button>
      </div>

    </div>

    
  </>
}
```

### Props
---
**Props** (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component. Props are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once set.

> `ParentComponent.js`
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';
```
```jsx
function ParentComponent() {
    return (
        <ChildComponent name="John Doe" age={30} />
    );
}
```
```jsx
export default ParentComponent;
```

> `ChildComponent.js`
```jsx
import React from 'react';
```
```jsx
function ChildComponent(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
            <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```
```jsx
export default ChildComponent;
```

### State
---
**State** is used to manage data that can change over time within a component. Unlike props, state is mutable and can be updated using the `setState` method (or `useState` hook in functional components). State is local to the component and cannot be accessed or modified by other components.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```
```jsx
function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
export default Counter;
```

# Child-to-Parent communications

![[Pasted image 20240801174230.png]]



# Deriving State
---
![State that is computed from an existing piece of state or from props.]

```jsx
const [cart, setCart] = useState([
	{name: "JavaScript Course", price: 15.99},
	{name: "Node.js Bootcamp", price: 14.99}
])
```


***Bad Practice***
```jsx
const [numItems, setNumItems]     = useState(2);
const [totalPrice, setTotalPrice] = useState(30.98);
```
---
- Three separate pieces of state, even though `numItems` and `totalPrice`
- Need to keep them in sync (update together)
- 3 state updates will cause 3 re-renders


***Good Practice***
```jsx
const numItems   = cart.length;
const totalPrice = cart.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur.price, 0)
```
---
- Just regular variables, no `useState`
- Cart state is the *single source of truth for this related* data
- Works because re-rendering component will *automatically re-calculate* derived state

# `App.jsx`

![App()]
```jsx
import { useState } from "react"

export default function App()
{
    return (
        <div>
            <TipCalculator />
        </div>
    )
}
```

![TipCalculator()]
```jsx

function TipCalculator()
{
    const [bill, setBill] = useState(0)
    const [percentage1, SelectPercentage1] = useState(0)
    const [percentage2, SelectPercentage2] = useState(0)

    const tip = bill * (percentage1 + percentage2) / (2 * 100)

    return <div>
        <BillInput 
		        bill={bill}
		        setBill={setBill}/>
        <SelectPercentage 
			    percentage={percentage1} 
			    SelectPercentage={SelectPercentage1}>
			How did you like the service? 
	    </SelectPercentage>
        <SelectPercentage 
			    percentage={percentage2}
			    SelectPercentage={SelectPercentage2}>
			How did your friend like the service?
		</SelectPercentage>
        <Output bill={bill} tip={tip} />
        <Reset />
    </div>
}
```

```jsx
function BillInput({ bill , setBill })
{ 
    return <div>
        <label>How much was the bill?</label>
        <input type="number" onChange={(e) => setBill(Number(e.target.value))}/>
    </div>
}
```


```jsx
function SelectPercentage({ percentage , SelectPercentage , children })
{


    return <div>
        <label>{children}</label>
        <select value={percentage} onChange={e => SelectPercentage(Number(e.target.value))}>
            <option value={0}  >    Very dissatisfied (0%)  </option>
            <option value={5}  >    dissatisfied (5%)       </option>
            <option value={10} >    Neutral (10%)           </option>
            <option value={15} >    satisfied (15%)         </option>
            <option value={20} >    Very satisfied (20%)    </option>
        </select>
    </div>
}
```

```jsx
function Output({ bill , tip })
{
    return <h3>You pay ${bill + tip} (${bill} + ${tip})</h3>
}
```

```jsx
function Reset()
{
    return <button>Reset</button>
}
```



# Using An API
---

In order to utilize APIs, you first have to ensure that `Axios` is installed:

```BaSH
npm run dev
```

Then your APIs could be written like the following, which uses the `Unsplash API`. 

```jsx
import axios from 'axios';

const api_link = "https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos"
const access_key = "8050V7bNzfKdVixwS9W9nZVdr0VnrCv9gmeimfdvp6Y"

const searchImages = async () => {
	const response = await axios.get(api_link, {
		headers:{
			Authorization: `Client-ID ${access_key}`
		},
		params:{
			query: "cars"
		}
	})

	return reponse	
}

export default searchImages
```



# JSON Server Issues and Required version
---

![[Pasted image 20240803072036.png]]


```BaSH
npm install json-server@0
```





# Creating a `context`
---
```jsx
const NumberContext = React.createContext();

function App() {
  return (
    <NumberContext.Provider value={42}>
      <Display />
    </NumberContext.Provider>
  );
}
```


## **Using `useContext`**:
---
```jsx
function Display() {
  const value = useContext(NumberContext);
  return <div>The answer is {value}.</div>;
}

```


## **Using `Consumer` (the traditional way)**:
---
```jsx
function Display() {
  return (
    <NumberContext.Consumer>
      {value => <div>The answer is {value}.</div>}
    </NumberContext.Consumer>
  );
}
```

# GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR COMPONENTS
---


![[Pasted image 20240805174521.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240805183958.png]]


💰 Be aware that creating a new component [creates a new abstraction]. Abstraction have a [cost], because [more abstractions require more mental energy] to switch back and forth between components. So try not to create new components too early.

🏷 Name a component according to [what it does] or [what it displays]. Don’t be afraid of using long component names.

🧅 Never declare a new component [inside another component!]

🗃 [Co-locate related components inside the same file.] Don’t separate components into different files too early.

↔  It's completely normal that an app has components of many different size, including very small and huge ones 



### Component categories
---

Most components will naturally fall into one of the following categories:

- Stateless / Presentation Components
	- [No state]
	- Can receive props and simply present received data or other content
	- Usually [small and reusable]

- Stateful Components
	- [Have state]
	- Can still be [reusable]

- structural Components 
	- “[Pages]”, “[Layouts]”, or “[Screens]” of the app
	- Result of [composition]
	- Can be [huge and non-reusable] (but don’t have to)


---

# React’s Cross-site scripted attack protection
----
React components all have a `$$typeof: Symbol(react.element)` 

[symbols cannot be transmitted via JSON, so if a fake react element is sent (from attackers), it will not have this property attached.]



# Calling components
---

calling components like

```jsx
<this />
```

is not the same as calling it like

```jsx
this()
```

because the top returns an [instance of a React component] whereas the bottom directly returns a [type “div” that is the raw element of that component].

React will not be able to see the component if it is passed like `this()`. So it is important to always call it using JSX like `<this />`.

![[Pasted image 20240808091536.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240808093723.png]]


# KEY PROP
---

- Special props that we use to tell the diffing algorithm that an element is unique
  
- Allows React to distinguish between multiple instances of the same component type
  
- When a key stays the same across renders, the element will be kept in the DOM (even if the position in the tree changes)

- Using keys in lists:
	- When a key changes between renders, the element will be destroyed and a new one will be created (even if the position in the tree is the same as before)
  
- Using keys to reset state


Assume a list of items [without keys],
```jsx
<ul>
	<Question question={q[1]} />
	<Question question={q[2]} />
</ul>
```

Assuming a new list item is added,
```jsx
<ul>
	<Question question={q[0]} />
	<Question question={q[1]} />
	<Question question={q[2]} />
</ul>
```

Same elements, but different positions in tree, so they are removed and recreated in the DOM (![BAD FOR PERFORMANCE])


If [keys] are used:
```JSX
<ul>
	<Question key="q1" question={q[1]} />
	<Question key="q2" question={q[2]} />
</ul>
```

When adding a new list item,
```JSX
<ul>
	<Question key="q0" question={q[0]} />
	<Question key="q1" question={q[1]} />
	<Question key="q2" question={q[2]} />
</ul>
```







---

Assume the following:


```jsx
function Question({question}){
	const [newAnswer, setNewAnswer] = useState('')
	const numAnswers = question.answers.length ?? 0;

	const handleNewAsnwer = function(e){
		if (question.closed) return;
		setNewAnswer(e.target.value)	
	}

	const createList = function(){
		return (
			<ul>
				{question.answers.map((q) => (
					<li>{q}</li>
				))}
			</ul>
		)
	}

	return (
	<div>
		<h3>{question.title}</h3>
		<p>{question.body}</p>
		{question.hasAnswer} ? (
			createList()
		) : (
			<input value={newAnswer} onChange={handleNewAnswer} />
		)
	)
}

```



# Render Logic

👉    Code that lives at the top level of the component function

👉    Participates in describing how the component view looks like

👉    Executed every time the component renders

[All `const` and `return` functions are part of the render logic]


# Event Handler Function

👉    Executed as a consequence of the event that the handler is listening for (change event in this example)

👉    Code that actually does things: update state, perform an HTTP, request, read an input field, navigate to another page, etc…

![[Pasted image 20240808154853.png]]

- By default, event handlers listen to events on the target *and during the bubbling phase*

- We can prevent bubbling with `e.stopPropagation()`



```
```

### Where to create *side effects* 
---
We need side effects all the time. They make our applications do something ![not] in render logic!


Side effects can be made in:

## Event handlers

- [Triggered by events: `onClick`, `onSubmit`, etc…]
  
- [Used to react to an event]

> 
> 👆 This is the preferred way for creating side effects!
> 

```jsx
function handleClicl(){
	fetch(`http://www.somewebsite.com`)
	.then((res)  => { res.json() })
	.then((data) => { setNewState(data) })
}
```

 


## `useEffect`

- [Effects allow us to write code that will run at different moments: mount, re-render, or unmount]

- [Used to keep a component synchronized with some external system]

```jsx
useEffect
( 
	function() 
	{
		fetch(`http://www.somewebsite.com`)
			.then((res)  => { res.json })
			.then((data) => { setNewState(data) })
		
		return () => { console.log("Cleanup") }
	}, []
)
```
> 
> The empty array at the end is called the “Dependency array.”
> 




```jsx

export default function App() {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);
  const [watched, setWatched] = useState([]);



  useEffect(function() {
    fetch(`http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=${KEY}&s=interstellar`)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => setMovies(data.Search))
  }, [])
```
> 
> The fetch is initiated upon mount as specified by the `[]` at the end of the `useEffect`.
> 
```jsx


  return (
    <>
      <NavBar>
        <Search />
        <NumResults movies={movies} />
      </NavBar>

      <Main>
        <Box>
          <MovieList movies={movies} />
        </Box>

        <Box>
          <WatchedSummary watched={watched} />
          <WatchedMoviesList watched={watched} />
        </Box>
      </Main>
    </>
  );
}

```

This ensures that the `useStates` aren’t stuck updating in an infinite loop, causing the `fetch` to run infinitely.




```jsx
const title = props.movie.Title;
const [userRating, setUserRating] = useState("")

useEffect(
	function(){
		if (!title) return;
		document.title = `${title} $
		{
			userRating && `(Rated ${userRating} 🌟)`
		}`
	}
)

```



```jsx
useEffect(fn, [x,y,z])
```
>  
>  [SYNCHRONIZATION] : Synchronizes with $x$, $y$, and $z$.
>  [LIFE CYCLE] : Runs on mount and re-renders triggered by updating $x$, $y$, or $z$.
>

```jsx
useEffect(fn, [])
```
>  
>  [SYNCHRONIZATION] : Synchronizes with no states/props
>  [LIFE CYCLE] : Runs only on mount (initial render)
>  


```jsx
useEffect(fn)
```
> 
>  [SYNCHRONIZATION] : Synchronizes with everything
>  [LIFE CYCLE] : Runs on every render, USUALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA
>
