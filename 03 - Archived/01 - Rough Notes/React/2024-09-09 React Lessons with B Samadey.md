# Understanding the Tools
---
- **React Router:** Used for client-side routing in React applications.
- **Redux Toolkit:** A toolkit for managing state in React applications.
- **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
- **Async Thunk:** A Redux middleware that allows you to perform asynchronous operations within your Redux actions.


### [[React Router]]
---
- **createBrowserRouter:** Creates a router instance.
- **RouterProvider:** Wraps your application to provide routing capabilities.
- **useNavigate:** Hook for navigating between routes.


### [[Redux Toolkit]]
---
- **createSlice:** Creates a Redux slice for managing a specific piece of state.
- **Async Thunk:**
    - **createAsyncThunk:** Creates an asynchronous thunk action creator.
- **ConfigureStore:** Configures the Redux store.


### [[Redux (Core Concepts)]]
---
- **clearAuthState:** (Assuming this is a custom function) Might be used to clear authentication state.
- **authSlice.actions:** Actions defined within the auth slice.
- **authSlice.reducer:** Reducer function for the auth slice.


**Additional Considerations:**

- If you have custom hooks or components, you might want to group them under a separate category.
- Consider using a more visual organization tool like a mind map or a tree diagram to better visualize the relationships between these concepts.
