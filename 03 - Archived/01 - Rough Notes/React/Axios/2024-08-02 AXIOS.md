**Axios** is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from both the browser and Node.js. It simplifies the process of interacting with APIs by providing a more powerful and flexible interface compared to the built-in `fetch` API or `XMLHttpRequest`.

### Key Features of Axios:

1. **Promise-based**: Axios uses Promises, making it easier to work with asynchronous operations.
   
2. **Interceptors**: You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled, allowing for tasks like adding authentication tokens.
   
3. **Automatic JSON Transformation**: Axios automatically transforms JSON data, so you don’t need to manually parse it.
   
4. **Error Handling**: It provides a more robust way to handle errors, including HTTP status codes.
   
5. **Request Cancellation**: Axios supports request cancellation, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to abort a request.
   
6. [**Client-Side Protection**: It includes built-in protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) attacks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-fetch-and-axios-js-for-making-http-requests/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-fetch-and-axios-js-for-making-http-requests/).

### Why Do We Need Axios?

- **Ease of Use**: Axios simplifies the syntax for making HTTP requests, making your code cleaner and more readable.
- **Enhanced Features**: It offers features like request and response interception, automatic transformation of JSON data, and better error handling.
- **Compatibility**: Axios works in both the browser and Node.js environments, making it versatile for different types of applications.
- [**Support for Older Browsers**: Axios supports older browsers, including Internet Explorer 8 and above](https://reflectoring.io/tutorial-guide-axios/)[2](https://reflectoring.io/tutorial-guide-axios/).
