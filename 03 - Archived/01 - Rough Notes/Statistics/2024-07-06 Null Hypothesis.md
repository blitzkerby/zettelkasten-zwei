The null hypothesis of correlation/linear regression is that the slope of the best-fit line is equal to zero; *in other words, as the X variable gets larger, the associated Y variable gets neither higher nor lower.*

It is possible to test the null hypothesis that the Y value predicted by the regression equation for a given value of X is equal to some theoretical expectation.

The most common would be testing the null hypothesis that the Y intercept = 0. 

This is rarely necessary for biological experiments.
