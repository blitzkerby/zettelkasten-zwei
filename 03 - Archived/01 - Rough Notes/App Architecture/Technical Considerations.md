## A More Technical Approach to University Major Filtering

### Data Structure and Database Design

**Relational Database:**

- **Major Table:**
    - `major_id` (primary key)
    - `major_name`
    - `category_id` (foreign key)
    - `subcategory_id` (foreign key)
- **Category Table:**
    - `category_id` (primary key)
    - `category_name`
- **Subcategory Table:**
    - `subcategory_id` (primary key)
    - `subcategory_name`
    - `category_id` (foreign key)

**Normalization:**

- To avoid redundancy and inconsistencies, normalize the data. For example, the `category_name` and `subcategory_name` are stored in separate tables, reducing duplication.

### Search Functionality

**Full-text Search:**

- Use a full-text search engine like Elasticsearch or Solr to efficiently search for majors based on keywords.
- Index the `major_name` and other relevant fields.
- Implement fuzzy matching to account for variations in spelling or typos.

### Filtering Logic

**SQL Queries:**

- Construct dynamic SQL queries based on user input.
- Use `JOIN` statements to combine data from different tables.
- Employ `WHERE` clauses to filter results based on specific criteria.

**Example Query:**

SQL

```
SELECT m.major_name
FROM Major m
JOIN Category c ON m.category_id = c.category_id
JOIN Subcategory s ON m.subcategory_id = s.subcategory_id
WHERE c.category_name = 'Engineering'
  AND s.subcategory_name = 'Computer Science'
  AND m.major_name LIKE '%software%'
```

Use code [with caution.](faq.md#coding)

### User Interface and Interaction

**JavaScript Framework:**

- Use a JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- Handle user interactions (e.g., checkbox selections, slider changes) and update the search results accordingly.

**API:**

- Develop a RESTful API to expose the search functionality and data to the frontend.
- Use HTTP methods like `GET` to retrieve data and `POST` to submit search criteria.

### Additional Considerations

- **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce database load for frequently accessed data.
- **Scalability:** Consider using a scalable database solution like MongoDB or Cassandra if dealing with a large volume of data.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the filter is accessible to users with disabilities by following web accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG).

By following this technical approach, you can create a robust and efficient university major filter that provides a valuable tool for users to find the right programs.
