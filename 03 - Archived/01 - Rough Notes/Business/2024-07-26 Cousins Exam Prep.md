## I. Ideal Questions (5 marks per item of the ideal questions) 





### (1) What are the advantages and disadvantages account receivables to a firm?
---

> **Accounts receivable** represent amounts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services sold on credit.
 
Advantages:

- Increased sales: Offering credit terms can attract customers and increase sales.
- Improved cash flow: While not immediate, accounts receivable contribute to overall cash flow.
* Competitive advantage: Credit terms can give a company a competitive edge.


Disadvantages:

- Credit risk: There's a risk of customers defaulting on their payments.
* Tied-up capital: Money invested in accounts receivable is unavailable for other uses.
- Administrative costs: Managing accounts receivable requires time and resources.
- Potential for bad debts: Some customers may not pay, resulting in losses.









### (2) What are the differences between Allowance Method and Direct Write-off Method for uncollectible account receivable? 
---

> Both methods account for uncollectible accounts, but they differ in timing and approach.
 

**Allowance Method:**

- **Matching principle:** Expenses (bad debts) are matched with related revenues.
- **Estimate of uncollectible accounts:** A company estimates the amount of bad debts and creates an allowance for doubtful accounts.
- **Matching principle:** Better reflects the true income of the period.
- **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) compliant.**

**Direct Write-Off Method:**

- **No allowance:** Bad debts are only recorded when a specific account is deemed uncollectible.
- **Mismatching of revenue and expenses:** Violates the matching principle.
- **Overstates assets:** Accounts receivable are overstated until written off.
- **Generally not accepted under GAAP.**









### (3) What is the definition of a plant asset? What is different type of plant assets? How different between a plant asset and a current asset?
---

> A **plant asset** (or fixed asset) is a long-term asset with a physical form that is used in the operations of a business and is not intended for sale.

**Types of plant assets:**

- **Land:** The earth's surface and anything permanently attached to it.
- **Buildings:** Structures used for business operations.
- **Equipment:** Machinery, furniture, and other assets used in operations.
- **Vehicles:** Cars, trucks, and other transportation assets.

**Difference between plant and current assets:**

- **Plant assets:** Have a long useful life, are not readily converted to cash, and are used in operations.
- **Current assets:** Expected to be converted to cash within one year, are more liquid.









### (4) How to allocate cost of a plant asset into an expense? Give your explanations to each method of the cost allocation of a plant asset. 
---
 
 > Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a plant asset over its useful life.

**Methods of depreciation:**

- **Straight-line method:** Allocates equal amounts of depreciation expense each year.
$$
	\large{
		\frac{\text{Cost}-\text{Salvage Value}}
				{\text{Useful Life}} = \text{Annual Depreciation}
	}
$$

- **Units-of-production method:** Allocates depreciation based on the asset's usage.
$$
	\large{
		\frac{\text{Cost}-\text{Salvage Value}}
				{\text{Total Estimated Units of Production}} = \text{Depreciation per Unit}
	}
$$

- **Declining-balance method:** Allocates a higher amount of depreciation in the early years and lower amounts in later years.
$$
	\large{
		\text{Book value at beginning of year} \times \text{Depreciation rate} = \text{Depreciation expense}
	}
$$

**Choice of method:** Depends on factors like asset usage, company policy, and tax implications.









### (5) How many forms of business company are there in general?
---

Generally, there are three primary forms of business organizations:

- **Sole proprietorship**
- **Partnership**
- **Corporation**









### (6) Give the definition of partnership. How many forms of partnership are there? Give your explanation to each form of partnership.
---

A **partnership** is a business owned by two or more people who share profits, losses, and control.

**Types of Partnerships:**

- **General Partnership:** All partners share in management, profits, and liabilities.
- **Limited Partnership:** At least one general partner manages the business and assumes unlimited liability, while limited partners contribute capital but have limited liability.
- **Limited Liability Partnership (LLP):** Similar to a general partnership, but partners have limited personal liability for the debts and actions of other partners.









### (7) What are the advantages and disadvantages of each form of the partnership?
---

**General Partnership:**

- **Advantages:** Easy to form, shared decision-making, tax advantages.
- **Disadvantages:** Unlimited liability, potential for disagreements, lack of continuity.

**Limited Partnership:**

- **Advantages:** Limited liability for limited partners, ability to raise capital.
- **Disadvantages:** Requires at least one general partner with unlimited liability, complex structure.

**Limited Liability Partnership:**

- **Advantages:** Limited liability for partners, tax advantages.
- **Disadvantages:** More complex to form than a general partnership, potential for higher fees.









### (8) What is corporation? How many forms of corporation are there?
---

A **corporation** is a legal entity separate from its owners (shareholders). It has the right to enter into contracts, own property, and sue or be sued.

**Forms of Corporations:**

- **C Corporation:** The most common type, subject to corporate income tax.
- **S Corporation:** A pass-through entity, meaning profits and losses pass through to shareholders' personal tax returns.

- **Disadvantages:** Double taxation, complex formation and regulation.

**S Corporation:**

- **Advantages:** Limited liability, pass-through taxation, easier to manage than a C Corporation.
- **Disadvantages:** Restrictions on shareholders, eligibility requirements.

**LLC:**

- **Advantages:** Limited liability, pass-through taxation, flexibility in management structure.
- **Disadvantages:** State-specific regulations, potential for double taxation in some cases. 









## II. Problems (10 marks per item of the problems)




### Problem 1

Gomez Corp. uses the allowance method to account for un-collectibles. On January 31, it wrote off an $800 account of a customer, C. Green. On March 9, it receives a $300 payment from Green. 
   
	1) Prepare the journal entry or entries for January 31. 
	2) Prepare the journal entry or entries for March 9; assume no additional money is expected from Green. 

---

### 1. January 31: Writing Off C. Green's Account

Since Gomez Corp. uses the allowance method, we will reduce the Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

- **Debit:** Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ($800)
- **Credit:** Accounts Receivable ($800)

**Journal Entry:**

| Date   | Account Title                   | Debit | Credit |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Jan 31 | Allowance for Doubtful Accounts | 800   |        |
|        | Accounts Receivable - C. Green  |       | 800    |


### 2. March 9: Receiving Payment from C. Green

The customer made a partial payment. This will increase Cash and decrease Accounts Receivable. However, since we previously wrote off the entire amount, we need to reinstate the account and then record the cash receipt.

**First Entry: Reinstating the Account**

- **Debit:** Accounts Receivable - C. Green ($800)
- **Credit:** Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ($800)

**Second Entry: Recording Cash Receipt**

- **Debit:** Cash ($300)
- **Credit:** Accounts Receivable - C. Green ($300)

**Journal Entries:**

| Date  | Account Title                   | Debit | Credit |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Mar 9 | Accounts Receivable - C. Green  | 800   |        |
|       | Allowance for Doubtful Accounts |       | 800    |
| Mar 9 | Cash                            | 300   |        |
|       | Accounts Receivable - C. Green  |       | 300    |


**Note:** The remaining balance of $500 in Accounts Receivable - C. Green would typically be considered uncollectible and written off again at a later date if no further payments are received.

### Problem 3

Martinez Company owns a building that appears on its prior year-end balance sheet at its original $572,000 cost less $429,000 accumulated depreciation. The building is depreciated on a straight-line basis assuming a 20-year life and no salvage value. During the first week in January of the current calendar year, major structural repairs are completed on the building at a $68,350 cost. The repairs extend its useful life for 5 years beyond the 20 years originally estimated. 

a) Determine the building’s age (plant asset age) as of the prior year-end balance 
sheet date. 

b. Prepare the entry to record the cost of the structural repairs that are paid in cash. 

c. Determine the book value of the building immediately after the repairs are 
recorded. 

d. Prepare the entry to record the current calendar year’s depreciation.

---
### a. Determine the building’s age (plant asset age) as of the prior year-end balance sheet date.

- **Annual depreciation:** $572,000 / 20 years = $28,600
- **Building age:** $429,000 accumulated depreciation / $28,600 annual depreciation = 15 years

**Therefore, the building's age as of the prior year-end balance sheet date is 15 years.**

### b. Prepare the entry to record the cost of the structural repairs that are paid in cash.

- **Debit:** Building ($68,350)
- **Credit:** Cash ($68,350)

**Journal Entry:**

|Date|Account Title|Debit|Credit|
|---|---|---|---|
|Jan|Building|68,350||
||Cash||68,350|


### c. Determine the book value of the building immediately after the repairs are recorded.

- **Original cost:** $572,000
- **Accumulated depreciation:** $429,000
- **Building cost after repairs:** $572,000 + $68,350 = $640,350
- **Book value:** $640,350 - $429,000 = $211,350

**Therefore, the book value of the building immediately after the repairs is $211,350.**

### d. Prepare the entry to record the current calendar year’s depreciation.

- **New total life:** 20 years (original) + 5 years (extension) = 25 years
    
- **Remaining life:** 25 years - 15 years (already depreciated) = 10 years
    
- **New depreciable base:** $640,350 (building cost after repairs)
    
- **Annual depreciation:** $640,350 / 10 years = $64,035
    
- **Debit:** Depreciation Expense ($64,035)
    
- **Credit:** Accumulated Depreciation - Building ($64,035)
    

**Journal Entry:**

|Date|Account Title|Debit|Credit|
|---|---|---|---|
|Dec 31|Depreciation Expense|64,035||
||Accumulated Depreciation - Building||64,035|










### Problem 4

Diaz Company owns a milling machine that cost $250,000 and has accumulated depreciation of $182,000. Prepare the entry to record the disposal of the milling machine on January 3 under each of the following independent situations. 


a. The machine needed extensive repairs, and it was not worth repairing. Diaz disposed of the machine, receiving nothing in return. 

b. Diaz sold the machine for $35,000 cash. 

c. Diaz sold the machine for $68,000 cash. 

d. Diaz sold the machine for $80,000 cash.

---

### Understanding the Problem

- Cost of milling machine: $250,000
- Accumulated depreciation: $182,000
- Book value: $250,000 - $182,000 = $68,000

### Journal Entries for Different Disposal Scenarios

#### a. Machine disposed of with no return

When an asset is disposed of with no return, it's essentially given away. The company will record a loss equal to the asset's book value.

|Date|Account Title|Debit|Credit|
|---|---|---|---|
|Jan 3|Accumulated Depreciation - Milling Machine|182,000||
||Loss on Disposal of Milling Machine|68,000||
||Milling Machine||250,000|


#### b. Machine sold for $35,000 cash

Since the selling price is less than the book value, there is a loss on disposal.

|Date|Account Title|Debit|Credit|
|---|---|---|---|
|Jan 3|Accumulated Depreciation - Milling Machine|182,000||
||Loss on Disposal of Milling Machine|33,000||
||Cash||35,000|
||Milling Machine||250,000|


#### c. Machine sold for $68,000 cash

In this case, the selling price equals the book value, resulting in no gain or loss.

|Date|Account Title|Debit|Credit|
|---|---|---|---|
|Jan 3|Accumulated Depreciation - Milling Machine|182,000||
||Cash||68,000|
||Milling Machine||250,000|


#### d. Machine sold for $80,000 cash

Since the selling price is greater than the book value, there is a gain on disposal.

| Date  | Account Title                              | Debit   | Credit  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| Jan 3 | Accumulated Depreciation - Milling Machine | 182,000 |         |
|       | Cash                                       |         | 80,000  |
|       | Milling Machine                            |         | 250,000 |
|       | Gain on Disposal of Milling Machine        |         | 12,000  |










### Problem 5

Timberly Construction negotiates a lump-sum purchase of several assets from a 
company that is going out of business. The purchase is completed on January 1, 
2015, at a total cash price of $900,000 for a building, land, land improvements, and four vehicles. The estimated market values of the assets are building, $508,800; land, $297,600; land improvements, $28,800; and four vehicles, $124,800. The company’s fiscal year ends on December 31. 

***Required*** 

a. Prepare a table to allocate the lump-sum purchase price to the separate assets 
purchased (round per- cents to the nearest 1%). Prepare the journal entry to 
record the purchase. 

b. Compute the depreciation expense for year 2015 on the building using the 
straight-line method, assuming a 15-year life and a $27,000 salvage value. 

c. Compute the depreciation expense for year 2015 on the land improvements 
assuming a five-year life and double-declining-balance depreciation.

---

**a. Allocation Table**

To allocate the lump-sum purchase price, we'll use the relative fair market value method.

|Asset|Fair Market Value|Percentage|Allocated Cost|
|---|---|---|---|
|Building|$508,800|56%|$504,000|
|Land|$297,600|33%|$297,000|
|Land Improvements|$28,800|3%|$27,000|
|Vehicles|$124,800|8%|$72,000|
|**Total**|$960,000|100%|$900,000|


**b. Journal Entry to Record Purchase**

|Date|Account Title|Debit|Credit|
|---|---|---|---|
|Jan 1, 2015|Building|$504,000||
||Land|$297,000||
||Land Improvements|$27,000||
||Vehicles|$72,000||
||Cash||$900,000|


## Depreciation Expense

### b. Depreciation Expense for Building

- **Cost:** $504,000
- **Salvage value:** $27,000
- **Depreciable base:** $504,000 - $27,000 = $477,000
- **Annual depreciation:** $477,000 / 15 years = $31,800

**Depreciation expense for year 2015 on the building is $31,800.**

### c. Depreciation Expense for Land Improvements

- **Cost:** $27,000
- **Salvage value:** Assumed to be $0 (common for land improvements)
- **Depreciable base:** $27,000
- **Depreciation rate:** 2 / 5 = 40% (double-declining-balance)

**Depreciation expense for year 2015:** $27,000 * 40% = $10,800

**Depreciation expense for year 2015 on land improvements is $10,800.**

**Note:** Double-declining-balance depreciation is an accelerated method that results in higher depreciation expense in the early years of an asset's life.
