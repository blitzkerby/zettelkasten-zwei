### Exclusive method vs inclusive method
---
The **exclusive** method excludes the median when identifying Q1 and Q3, while the **inclusive** method includes the median in identifying the quartiles.

The procedure for finding the median is different depending on whether your data set is odd- or even-numbered.

- When you have an **odd number** of data points, the median is the value in the middle of your data set. You can choose between the inclusive and exclusive method.

- With an **even number** of data points, there are two values in the middle, so the median is their [mean](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/mean/). It’s more common to use the exclusive method in this case.
