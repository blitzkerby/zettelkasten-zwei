## Inflation Forecast Report - Next Quarter (July-September 2024)

**Introduction**

This report presents a forecast for inflation in the upcoming quarter (July-September 2024) using a weighted average approach based on various economic indicators.

**Methodology**

1. **Data Acquisition:**

- Actual inflation rates for the current quarter for indicators like Employment Cost Index (ECI), Price Deflator, etc., are required (replace placeholder values in the code).
- Predicted inflation rates for the next quarter for each indicator need to be obtained from a separate source (not shown in the code).

2. **Inflation Rate Prediction (for individual indicators):**

- A linear regression model is used to predict the inflation rate for the next quarter for each economic indicator included in the analysis.
- The model utilizes historical data on the indicator to estimate its future trend.

3. **Weighting Scheme:**

- Weights are assigned to each indicator based on its perceived influence on overall inflation. Indicators with a stronger impact receive higher weights.

4. **Combined Inflation Rate Calculation:**

- The actual inflation rates (current quarter) and predicted inflation rates (next quarter) for each indicator are combined using a weighted average formula.
- This calculation provides a single, comprehensive forecast for inflation in the next quarter.

**Results**

**Forecasted Inflation Rate:** Based on the provided data and weights, the model predicts an inflation rate of approximately **2.52%** for the next quarter.

**Individual Indicator Forecasts:**

The code outputs predicted inflation rates for each indicator included in the analysis. However, the accuracy of these individual predictions depends on the quality of the historical data used in the linear regression model.

**Limitations**

- This approach relies on several assumptions, including the accuracy of historical data, the effectiveness of the linear regression model for each indicator, and the appropriateness of the chosen weights.
- The model may not capture the full complexity of inflation dynamics, which can be influenced by various unforeseen factors.

**Conclusion**

This report provides a preliminary forecast for inflation in the next quarter based on a weighted average of various economic indicators. It is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this model and consider incorporating additional data sources and economic insights for a more robust forecast.
