### Overview of Deployment 

- Deployment is the process of moving our application from a development or staging environment into production, becoming accessible to users.

- The high-level flow is as follows:
	- **Development:**
		- **Coding and Testing :** Developers  write code and run tests locally.
		
	- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
		- **Automated Testing:** Every change (commit) is automatically tested to ensure it doesnâ€™t break the application
		  
	- **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
		- **Build Process:** The application is built into a deployable state, often as Docker images.
		- **Automated Deployment:** The built application is deployed to a staging environment for further testing.
		- **Approval Process:** After passing tests in the staging environment, the deployment is approved and pushed to production
		
	- **Production**:
		- **Deployment:** The application is deployed to a production environment (cloud servers, on-premises servers, or managed services).
		- **Monitoring:** Cloud provider-specific monitoring tools are used to track application performance and errors.
		
	- **Maintenance and Monitoring:** 
		- **Logging:** Real-time logging of application behavior to troubleshoot issues.
		- **Alerts:** Set up alerts to notify the team of any critical issues
		- **Regular Updates:** Apply security patches and updates regularly to maintain the integrity and security of application
		  
### Streamlining Production

- **Automation**:
	- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automate the build, test, and deployment processes using CI/CD tools.
	- **Automated Tests:** Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the code is working as expected before it reaches production.
	
- **Containerization:** 
	- **Docker:** allow for the application to run consistently across different environments.
	- **Kubernetes:** manage containerized applications, ensuring scalability and reliability.

- **Logging:** Implement centralized logging using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or cloud-specific logging services.
