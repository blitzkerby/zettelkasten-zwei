### **Definition**

A function is called ***piecewise continuous*** on an interval if the interval can be broken into a finite number of subintervals on which the function is continuous on each open subinterval and has finite limit at the endpoints of each subinterval.

Suppose that $f(t)$ is a piecewise continuous function. The Laplace transform of $f(t)$ is denoted $\mathcal{L}\{f (t)\}$ and defined as

$$\large{
	\mathcal{L}\{ f(t)\} 
		= \int_{0}^{\infty} {e^{-st} f(t)} \ dt
}$$
