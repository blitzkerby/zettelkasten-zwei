## Null Hypothesis

The null hypothesis of correlation/linear regression is that the slope of the best-fit line is equal to zero; in other words, as the 𝑋𝑋 variable gets larger, the associated 𝑌𝑌 variable gets neither higher nor lower.

It is also possible to test the null hypothesis that the 𝑌𝑌 value predicted by the regression equation for a given value of 𝑋𝑋 is equal to some theoretical expectation; the most common would be testing the null hypothesis that the 𝑌𝑌 intercept is 00. This is rarely necessary in biological experiments, so I won't cover it here, but be aware that it is possible.
