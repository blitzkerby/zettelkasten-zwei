# Range

## Definition

The set of all numerical values of a variable quantity is called the ***range*** of the variable.



An ***open interval*** is the collection of all numbers $\large{x}$ lying between and excluding the given numbers $\large{a}$ and $\large{b}$  $\large(a < b)$; it is denoted:

$$
\large{
	(a,b) 
	\ \
	\text{ or } 
	\ \
	a < x < b
}
$$


A ***closed interval*** is the set of all numbers $\large{x}$ lying between and including the two given numbers $\large{a}$ and $\large{b}$; it is denoted:

$$
\large{
	[a,b]
	\ \
	\text{ or }
	\ \
	a \le x \le b
}
$$


If one of the numbers $\large{a}$ or $\large{b}$  (say, $\large{a}$) belongs to the interval, while the other does not, we have a partly closed interval; denoted:

$$
\large{
	(a,b]
	\ \
	\text{ or }
	\ \
	a \le x < b
}
$$

If $\large{b}$ belongs to the set and $\large{a}$ does not, it is denoted:

$$
\large{
	[a,b)
	\ \
	\text{ or }
	\ \
	a < x \le b
}
$$

If the variable $\large{x}$ assumes all possible values greater than $\large{a}$, such an interval is denoted:
$$
\large{ 
	(a, \infty)
	\ \
	\text{ or }
	\ \
	a < x < \infty
}

$$


The ***neighborhood*** of a given point $\large{x_0}$
