# Chapter I
Number. Variable. Function.

## SECTION 2
THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF A REAL NUMBER

---

### **Definition** 

The absolute value (or modulus) of a real number x (written $| x |$) is a non-negative real number that satisfies the conditions:

$$
\huge{
	\begin{matrix}
		\begin{align}
			|x| &= x   & \text{if }x \ge 0 \\ 
			|x| &= -x  & \text{if }x < 0
		\end{align}
	\end{matrix}
}
$$

The following is true:


> I. The absolute value of an algebraic sum of several real numbers is not greater than the sum of the absolute values of the terms.

$$
\huge{

	|x+y| \le |x| + |y|

}
$$
