> [[Hooke’s Law]] is an empirical law which states that the force needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance, $\large x$, scales linearly with respect to that distance:
$$\large{
	F_s = kx
}$$

- $\large k$ is the spring constant, *stiffness* ($N \cdot m^-1$)
- $\large x$ is the displacement ($\large m$)

> [[Newton’s Second Law|Newton’s Second Law]] states that, the change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed; and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed.

$$\large\begin{align}
	\vec{F} = -kx \hat{x}
\end{align}$$
The only other forces exerted on the mass are its *weight* and the *normal force* from the horizontal surface, which are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
