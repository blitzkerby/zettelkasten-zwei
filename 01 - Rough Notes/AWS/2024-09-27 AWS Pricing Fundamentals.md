# Pricing Models

### Pay-as-you-go

- Easily adapt to changing business needs
- Improved responsiveness to change
- Adapt based on needs, not forecasts
  
  
### Save when you reserved

- Invest in reserved capacity (e.g.: RDS and EC2)
- Save up to 75% compared to on-demand (pay-as-you-go)
- The more you pay upfront the greater the discount
  
  
### Pay less by using more

- Pay less using volume-based discounts
- Tiered pricing means the more you use the lower the unit pricing
