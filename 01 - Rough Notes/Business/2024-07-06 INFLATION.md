# Measurements of inflation

Inflation is a complex economic phenomenon that can be measured in various ways. Here are some of the most common measurements of inflation:

## **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The CPI measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services purchased by households. It is the most widely used measure of inflation and is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States.

### Calculating CPI

- Gather prices for common products or services in the past
- Collect prices for current products or services
- Add the product prices together
- Divide the current product price total by the past price total
- Multiply the total by 100
* Convert this number into Percentage


**EXAMPLE**

Say you're calculating the costs of certain grocery food items made from one brand from the year 2018 to the year 2020. After gathering the receipts to determine the prices for certain products, your list would look like this:

| YEAR | MACARONI NOODLES PRICE | PASTA SAUCE PRICE | TOTAL |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| 2020 | $3                     | $3.75             | $6.75 |
| 2022 | $4                     | $4.50             | $8.50 |

After adding your 2018 product prices, the total would be $6.75. The sum for 2020 products is $8.50. When you divide the current product price total by the past price total, your equation is 8.50 / 6.75 = 1.26. You'd then multiply this total by 100, which would be 1.44 x 100 = 125.9. Subtract this total from 100 to receive your final percentage of change, which is 25.9%.


This means there is a 25.9% change in product prices since 2018. The entire equation would be 9.70 / 8.50 = 1.26 x 100 = 125.9 - 100 = 25.9.



$$
\text{CPI} = \frac{EV}{AC}
$$


$$
\text{Annual CPI} = \frac{\text{Value of Basket in Current}}
					{\text{Value of Basket in Prior Year}} \times 100\%					
$$
$$
\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{\text{New CPI} - \text{Prior CPI}}
							{\text{Prior CPI}}\times 100\%
$$

**Example**:
Letâ€™s say we want to calculate the CPI for a basket of goods and services that includes:

- Bread: $1.00 (base year)
- Milk: $2.00 (base year)
- Rent: $500.00 (base year)

In the current year, the prices of these items are:

- Bread: $1.20
- Milk: $2.50
- Rent: $550.00

To calculate the CPI, we first calculate the weighted average of the prices of these items. The weights are based on the proportion of the total basket that each item represents.

- Bread: 20% of the basket
- Milk: 30% of the basket
- Rent: 50% of the basket

Weighted average price:

- Bread: $1.20 x 0.20 = $0.24
- Milk: $2.50 x 0.30 = $0.75
- Rent: $550.00 x 0.50 = $275.00

Total weighted average price: $0.24 + $0.75 + $275.00 = $275.99

To calculate the CPI, we divide the weighted average price by the base year price and multiply by 100:

CPI = (275.99 / 1.00) x 100 = 275.99%

This means that the CPI has increased by 275.99% since the base year.




- **Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index**: The PCE Price Index measures the average change in prices of goods and services purchased by households, but it is calculated differently than the CPI. It is also calculated by the BLS.

- **GDP Deflator**: The GDP Deflator measures the average change in prices of all goods and services produced within a country, including both consumer and producer prices.

- **Producer Price Index (PPI)**: The PPI measures the average change in prices of goods and services at the production level, before they reach the consumer.

- **Chained CPI**: The Chained CPI is a variant of the CPI that adjusts for changes in consumer spending patterns over time.

- **Core Inflation**: Core inflation measures the rate of inflation excluding volatile prices of food and energy.

These measurements of inflation are important because they help policymakers and economists understand the underlying trends and patterns of inflation, which can inform decisions about monetary policy and economic growth.
