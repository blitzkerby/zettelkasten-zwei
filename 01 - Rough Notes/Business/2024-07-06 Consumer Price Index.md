# Consumer Price index


### When is it used?
---
> Consumer price index (CPI) is used to see whatâ€™s happening with inflation. 

### What does it measure?
---
> CPI measures changes in the prices for a market basket of goods/services.





* The value of money changes overtime. When there is inflation, purchasing power goes down, and vice versa. CPI can be used to measure this : by using a *basket of goods.* 

* We measure the cost of these basket of goods at some year and compare it to the next. If:
	- Those goods cost more, we see inflation
	- Those goods cost less, we see deflation.



### How to create a CPI 
---
1. Select a base year
2. Select the market basket (list of goods whose prices we want to keep track of)
3. Record the prices for the items in the market basket
4. Use the CPI formula


*REGULAR NOTATION:*
$$
\text{CPI} = \frac{ \text{Value of current market basket} }
				{ \text{Value of market basket in base year} } \times 100\%
$$

*KERBIAN NOTATION:*
$$
\text{CPI}_i = \frac{ \text{Basket}_i }{ \text{Basket}_0 } \times 100\%
$$
Where,
	$\text{CPI}_i$ is the CPI at some year, $i$
	$\text{Basket}_i$ is the (market) basket at some year, $i$
	$\text{Basket}_0$ is the (market) basket at base year

Example

| Year        | Market Basket | CPI  |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---- |
| 2014        | $15           | 60%  |
| 2015 (Base) | $25           | 100% |
| 2016        | $30           | 120% |
| 2017        | $40           | 160% |
| 2018        | $55           | 220% |
| 2019        | $65           | 260% |


### How to measure inflation
---

*REGULAR NOTATION*:
$$
\% \text{changes in prices} = \frac{\text{Year 2} - \text{Year 1}}
									{\text{Year 1}}            \times 100\%
$$

*KERBIAN NOTATION:*
$$
\text{Inflation} = \Delta \text{Price}_{\%} = \frac{\text{Price}_{i+1} - \text{Price}_{i}}
													{\text{Price}_{i}} \times 100\%
$$

Example

| Year        | Market Basket | CPI  | Inflation Rate  |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---- | --------------- |
| 2014        | $15           | 60%  | N/A             |
| 2015 (Base) | $25           | 100% | $66.6\bar{6}\%$ |
| 2016        | $30           | 120% | $20\%$          |
| 2017        | $40           | 160% | $33.3\bar{3}\%$ |
| 2018        | $55           | 220% | $37.5\%$        |
| 2019        | $65           | 260% | $18.\bar{18}$   |
