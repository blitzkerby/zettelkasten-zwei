According to the available information, Cambodia's agricultural sector is characterized by an agriculture-oriented economy, with a significant contribution to the country’s GDP. However, the quality of agriculture in Cambodia is not explicitly mentioned in the provided search results.

However, we can look at the overall ranking of Cambodia in terms of agricultural production and competitiveness in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region. According to the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) 2014-2015, Cambodia ranked 97th out of 144 economies in terms of agricultural productivity, which is a key indicator of agricultural quality.

In terms of agricultural competitiveness, Cambodia ranked 85th out of 144 economies in the GCI 2012-2013, indicating a relatively low level of competitiveness in the agricultural sector.

While we do not have a specific ranking for Cambodia's agricultural quality in SEA, we can infer that the country’s agricultural sector faces challenges in terms of productivity and competitiveness. However, the government has been implementing policies to improve the sector’s performance, including the establishment of a science and technology foundation to promote industrial innovation, with a focus on agriculture.
