## Designing a University Major Filter: A Feasible Approach
---
**Yes, building a university major filter is definitely feasible, even with the vast number of unique majors.** The key is to design a system that is efficient, user-friendly, and scalable.

# Architecture Considerations
---
1. # **Hierarchical Structure:**
    
    - **Categorize Majors** 
      Group majors into broader categories like Arts, Sciences, Engineering, etc.
    
    - **Subcategories**
      Further divide categories into subcategories (e.g., "Computer Science" under "Engineering").
      
    - **Specific Majors**
      List individual majors within subcategories.
      
2. **Search Functionality:**
    
    - **Keyword Search**
      Allow users to search for majors using specific keywords or phrases.
      
    - **Autocomplete** 
      Suggest potential majors as users type.
      
    - **Fuzzy Matching** 
      Account for minor variations in major names.
      
3. **Filtering Options:**
    
    - **Checkbox or Dropdown Menus:** Users can select multiple categories, subcategories, or specific majors.
      
    - **Sliders:** For numerical attributes (e.g., average class size, tuition).
      
    - **Range Inputs:** For attributes with minimum and maximum values (e.g., average GPA required).
      
4. **Data Storage:**
    
    - **Database:** Store major information in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for efficient querying and filtering.
      
    - **Normalization:** Ensure data is normalized to avoid redundancy and inconsistencies.
      
5. **User Interface:**
    
    - **Intuitive Design:** Create a clean and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate.
      
    - **Visual Aids:** Consider using icons or images to represent different categories or majors.

### Examples of Similar Filters

- **College Board's Major Finder:** This tool allows users to search for majors based on interests and explore colleges that offer them.
  
- **Peterson's College Search:** Provides a filter for majors, as well as other criteria like location, size, and cost.

### Alternative Approaches

If you're concerned about the sheer number of majors, you could explore:

- **Tagging System:** Assign relevant tags to each major (e.g., "STEM," "liberal arts," "interdisciplinary"). Users can filter based on tags.
  
- **Recommendation Engine:** Use machine learning algorithms to suggest majors based on a user's interests or previous searches.
  
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combine hierarchical categorization with tagging or recommendation systems for a more comprehensive filtering experience.

By carefully considering these factors and leveraging effective design principles, you can create a university major filter that is both informative and user-friendly.
