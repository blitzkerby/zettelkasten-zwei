### What is a Root User in AWS IAM?

A $\text{root user}$ is the highest level of user in the AWS account; essentially the ‘super admin’ user – with full, unrestricted permissions to access AWS resources, modify permissions for users and roles, and any other actions within the environment.

>
>	The $\text{root user}$ should never be used for day to day activities, even administrative ones. It should only be used for the most essential tasks that can only be performed with root permissions.
>	
>	These actions include changing account settings, restoring IAM user permissions, etc…
